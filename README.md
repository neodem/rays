a test 3d game thing

This is an experimental project where I try to implement some of the ideas in the "Game Engine Black Book : Wolfenstein 3D" book by Fabien Sanglard.

Clearly I'm doing this in java which is not performant nor anywhere in the spirit of the code Id wrote 20+ years ago.

The idea is to simply learn some of the concepts and problems faced when building and projecting through a 3d world.
