a test 3d game thing

This is an experimental project where I try to implement some of the ideas in the "Game Engine Black Book : Wolfenstein 3D" book by Fabien Sanglard.

I'm doing this in java which is clearly not performant nor anywhere in the spirit of the code Id wrote 20+ years ago.

The idea is to simply learn some of the concepts and problems faced when building and projecting through a 3d world.

# To Run

(requires java 11 and maven)

mvn clean compile exec:exec 

(or simply run ./run.sh)

--- 
#TODO

- Don't allow a player to walk through walls
